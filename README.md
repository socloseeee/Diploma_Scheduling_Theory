# Diploma_Scheduling_Theory
Solving an inhomogeneous minemax problem of scheduling theory by the goldberg method with different formation of the initial generation.
For the formation of the initial generation, algorithms are considered: The method of minimal elements, the Plotnikov-Zverev method, the method of squares and the barrier method

### The method of minimal elements

## Directory description
Diploma_Scheduling_Theory/diploma/experiments - this is a directory in which, through multiple iterations, the results of the GA execution under different conditions are singled out for the purpose of their subsequent comparison.

Diploma_Scheduling_Theory/diploma/methods_analysis - this is a directory in which we can carefully verify that all the given methods work correctly and check the results of their execution.
